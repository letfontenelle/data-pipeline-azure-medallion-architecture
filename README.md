# Water Quality Analysis Pipeline with Azure

## **Project Description**

This project focuses on building a **data pipeline** to analyze large sensor datasets collected from water bodies across European countries. By leveraging **Azure Services**, the pipeline ingests, processes, and visualizes data to gain insights into water quality trends and determinands. The implementation of **medallion architecture** ensures data quality and structured transformation, enabling efficient analytics and decision-making.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Languages:** SQL, Python  
- **Services:**  
  - Azure Managed SQL Server  
  - Azure Blob Storage  
  - Azure Data Lake Gen2  
  - Azure Data Factory  
  - Azure Databricks  
  - Azure Logic Apps  
  - Power BI

## **Approach**

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - Pull data from **Azure SQL Database** using **Azure Logic Apps**.  
   - Store raw data in **Azure Blob Storage**.

2. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Use **Azure Data Factory** to move data to **Azure Data Lake Gen2**.  
   - Apply medallion architecture (bronze, silver, gold layers) for structured processing.

3. **Data Processing:**  
   - Perform cleaning and transformation in **Azure Databricks**.  
   - Store processed data in a Hive metastore database.

4. **Visualization:**  
   - Use **Power BI** to generate insights on water quality trends and determinands.

## **How to Run the Project**

1. **Set Up Azure Services:**  
   - Create Azure SQL Database, Blob Storage, Data Lake, Data Factory, Logic Apps, and Databricks instances.

2. **Ingest Data:**  
   - Configure Logic Apps and ADF pipelines to move data to ADLS Gen2.

3. **Process Data:**  
   - Use Databricks to clean, transform, and organize data into medallion layers.

4. **Visualize Insights:**  
   - Connect Power BI to the processed data for reporting and analytics.
